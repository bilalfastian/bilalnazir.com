I am basically a software developer with full stack development expertise of over 5+ years, from developing APIs in NodeJS, or Java or PHP to writing application front-end with ReactJS including integration with third party services. 

I also have experience on Salesforce CRM for developing cloud applications on Force.com platform.

When Iâ€™m not working I like to learn new technologies, currently I am into Machine Learning and have interest to pursue this professionaly.
